# Rust data structure

A place, where I implement common data structures in Rust language.

A few data structures are not a good idea to use in production because I implement them for my hobbies, such as:
 - StaticHeapArray, should use Rust standard array, that allocates on stack
 - Linked list, use std::collections::LinkedList instead

Peace!
